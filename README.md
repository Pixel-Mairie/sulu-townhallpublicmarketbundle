``` 

## üëç Use
### Add/Edit
Go to the "Town hall" section in the administration interface. Then, click on "Public market".
To add, simply click on "Add". Fill the fields that are needed for your use.

Here is the list of the fields:
* Title (mandatory)
* URL (mandatory and filled automatically according to the title)
* Published at (filled manually)
* Status (mandatory)
* Description (mandatory)
* List of documents

Once you finished, click on "Save".

The public market you added is not visible on the website yet. In order to do that, click on "Activate?". It should be now visible for visitors.

To edit, simply click on the pencil at the left of the entity you wish to edit.

The edit form has a preview where you can see all your changes being updated live.

### Status
A public market **must** have a status. This status allows you to determine at which step is your public market.

To create status:
* You **must** create a root category which **must** have its key named "publics_markets"
* Then, under this root category, you create all the categories you need

### Remove/Restore

There are two ways to remove a public market:
* Check every public market you want to remove and then click on "Delete"
* Go to the detail of a public market (see the "Add/Edit" section) and click on "Delete".

In both cases, the public market will be put in the trash.

To access the trash, go to the "Settings" and click on "Trash".
To restore a public market, click on the clock at the left. Confirm the restore. You will be redirected to the detail of the public market you restored.

To remove permanently a public market, check all the public markets you want to remove and click on "Delete".
